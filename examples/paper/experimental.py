# sampled at 20kHz, i.e. 0.05ms per time steps.

# usually, ~4ms time bins (windows) is a good initial guess

# however, in this dataset we will find theta oscillations.
# let's try the other fit functions, too.

# if we want error estimates for the complex fit, we can provide
# ```numboot=200```, but it is quite slow.

# to save the files to disk, we can specify a targetdirectory.
# in the text file, the frequency of the fitted oscillations can be found.

# by assigning the result of mre.full_analysis(...) to a variable, we can
# use fit results for further processing.

# the oscillation frequency nu is fitted by the complex fit functions as the
# 7th parameter. it is in units of 1/dtunit and we used 'ms'.
