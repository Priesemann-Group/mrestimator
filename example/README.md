# Mr. Estimator Example Script

Instead of downloading the source data manually or cloning the whole repo (Github does not support [downloading subdirectories](https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/95) ), you can grab the scripts and run

```
python3 create_example_data.py
```

which will create the example data in the directory where `create_example_data.py` was saved.
